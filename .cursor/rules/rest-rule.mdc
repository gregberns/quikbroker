The following are rules to 

- All REST endpoints should be built with the [express-zod-api](https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api) framework
- For consuming the OpenApi spec, use [openapi-zod-client](https://github.com/astahmer/openapi-zod-client/)
- Once API endpints are generated, a client should be generated to correspond to that spec.
- All UI code, should consume the REST data through the client
