# Freight Carrier Management System Requirements

> **Note**: This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Freight Carrier Management System. For implementation priorities, guidelines on marking features as complete, and testing requirements, please refer to the [Project Priorities and Guidelines](./ProjectPrioritiesAndGuidelines.md) document.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a secure, efficient carrier onboarding system that helps freight brokers streamline the process of verifying, validating, and managing carrier relationships. By automating document collection, verification, and compliance monitoring, the system will help brokers reduce fraud risk, ensure regulatory compliance, and accelerate the onboarding process.

## Value Proposition

The Freight Carrier Management System delivers the following key benefits to brokers:

1. **Risk Reduction**: Automated verification of carrier credentials, insurance status, and operating authority minimizes the risk of fraud and ensures compliance with industry regulations.

2. **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined digital onboarding reduces manual paperwork, eliminates duplicate data entry, and accelerates the carrier setup process by up to 80%.

3. **Compliance Assurance**: Continuous monitoring of carrier credentials and automatic alerts for expiring documents ensure brokers maintain compliance with FMCSA regulations.

4. **Fraud Prevention**: Advanced cross-verification of carrier information helps identify potential red flags and suspicious patterns that might indicate fraudulent carriers.

5. **Process Standardization**: Consistent, documented onboarding workflows ensure that all regulatory and internal requirements are met for every carrier.

6. **Time Savings**: Automated document collection and verification free broker staff from administrative tasks, allowing them to focus on building carrier relationships and moving freight.

7. **Cost Reduction**: Fewer manual processes mean lower operational costs and reduced human error.

8. **Enhanced Carrier Experience**: Digital onboarding provides carriers with a professional, modern experience that reflects positively on the broker's brand.

This value proposition should be prominently featured in the system's marketing materials, particularly on the landing page designed to attract broker sign-ups.
