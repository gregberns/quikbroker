# Project Priorities and Development Guidelines

## 1. Feature Prioritization Framework

The following prioritization framework has been established to guide the development of the Freight Carrier Management System in a logical, efficient manner. This framework is designed to be adaptable as the project evolves while maintaining focus on delivering critical functionality first.

The primary objective of this project is to create an efficient carrier onboarding system for freight brokers. All prioritization decisions should be made with this core objective in mind.

### 1.1 Priority Levels

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| P0 | **Critical Core** - Essential for basic system functionality; must be completed first |
| P1 | **High Value** - Delivers significant business value; should be implemented early |
| P2 | **Important** - Needed features that enhance the system but aren't blocking |
| P3 | **Nice to Have** - Features that add value but can be deferred if necessary |
| P4 | **Future Enhancement** - Planned for future phases; not in initial MVP |

### 1.2 Prioritization Rationale

The prioritization of features is based on the following key principles, which future AI agents should consider when refining priorities:

1. **Foundation First**: Core authentication, data models, and basic workflows must be established before building more complex features.

2. **Value Delivery**: Features that deliver immediate business value to primary users (Brokers) are prioritized over administrative or secondary features.

3. **Risk Mitigation**: Features that address compliance, security, or industry regulations are prioritized to mitigate business risks early.

4. **User Acquisition Path**: Features required for the initial user onboarding process are prioritized to enable real-world testing.

5. **Technical Dependencies**: Features with significant dependencies are sequenced appropriately, with foundational components built first.

6. **Feedback Loops**: Early delivery of core features enables faster feedback cycles, informing the development of subsequent features.

7. **Resource Optimization**: Features are sequenced to optimize development resources and minimize context switching.

## 2. Prioritized Feature List

The following list represents the current prioritization of features for development. This list should be reviewed and updated regularly as development progresses and requirements evolve.

## 3. Feature Completion Guidelines

To maintain clarity and consistency in tracking development progress, the following guidelines should be followed when marking features as complete.

### 3.1 Feature Completion Checklist

A feature is considered complete when it meets all of the following criteria:

- [ ] **Functional Requirements**: All specified requirements are implemented and working
- [ ] **Testing**: Automated tests are written and passing (see Testing Requirements section)
- [ ] **Documentation**: User documentation and/or inline code documentation is complete
- [ ] **Code Review**: Code has been reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: All acceptance criteria defined in the user story are met
- [ ] **UI/UX**: Interface components meet design standards and accessibility requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: Feature meets defined performance requirements

### 3.2 Marking Features as Complete

When a feature is complete, update the status in the Prioritized Feature List:

1. Change the status column from ⬜ (uncompleted) to ✅ (completed)
2. Add a completion date in parentheses after the status
3. Update any documentation, user guides, or other affected resources

Example:
```markdown
| ✅ (2023-05-15) | User Authentication System | P0 | Basic login, registration, password management | Foundation for all security and user-specific features |
```

## 4. Testing Requirements

All features must include appropriate tests to ensure functionality, reliability, and maintainability.

### 4.1 Types of Required Tests

Each feature should include, at minimum, the following types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Cover critical logic and edge cases
   - Aim for high code coverage of business logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between components
   - Verify correct data flow between components
   - Test API endpoints and database interactions

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Test complete user workflows from start to finish
   - Simulate real user interaction with the system
   - Verify critical business processes function correctly

4. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - Ensure interface components meet WCAG standards
   - Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
   - Verify color contrast and text legibility

### 4.2 Testing Guidelines

The following guidelines should be followed when writing tests:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: When possible, write tests before implementing features
2. **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage for business logic
3. **Mocking**: Use mocks and stubs for external services and dependencies
4. **Test Organization**: Keep tests organized in a structure that mirrors the application
5. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names that indicate what's being tested
6. **Automated Testing**: Ensure tests can be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline
7. **Test Documentation**: Document test scenarios, especially for complex business rules

### 4.3 Test Documentation

For each feature, maintain a test documentation file in the `tests/docs` directory that includes:

1. Test strategy overview
2. Key test scenarios
3. Testing gaps or known limitations
4. External dependencies or test data requirements

## 5. Priority Refinement Process

This prioritization framework is designed to be adapted as the project evolves. Future AI agents or development teams should follow this process when refining priorities:

1. **Regular Review**: Review and adjust priorities at least once per sprint
2. **Stakeholder Input**: Incorporate feedback from key stakeholders
3. **Technical Discoveries**: Adjust based on technical findings during development
4. **Market Changes**: Consider evolving market conditions and competitive landscape
5. **User Feedback**: Prioritize based on user feedback once features are in production

When refining priorities, update this document with:
- Changes to feature priorities
- Rationale for priority changes
- New features added to the roadmap
- Features removed from consideration

All changes should maintain the core prioritization principles outlined in section 1.2.

## 6. Project Health Metrics

To assess project progress and health, the following metrics should be tracked:

1. **Feature Completion Rate**: Percentage of planned features completed versus total features
2. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests
3. **Bug Density**: Number of bugs per feature or per line of code
4. **Technical Debt**: Assessment of code quality and maintenance burden
5. **Velocity**: Team's delivery rate of features over time
6. **User Satisfaction**: Measurements of user experience and satisfaction

These metrics should be reviewed regularly to ensure the project is on track and to inform priority adjustments.
